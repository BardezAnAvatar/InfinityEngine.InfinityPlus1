I am referencing an unpublished file known as "mve-fmt.txt" for all of this code. I received it in an e-mail from
my old TeamBG days, when the community was paranoid about Interplay cracking skulls about this format, as well
as ACM.

Interplay is now more or less dead in its form compared to the previous one, which in some views might take away
its teeth; my concern is more towards utility. MVE is outdated and unnecessary, very clamped down and its content
is locked away in unremarkable containers. It's not like there's a set of DirectShow filters for playing MVEs,
much less any probability of getting info from the likes of Interplay.

So, hopefully I can crack open the can a little bit, expose some of the data and be able to export it to raw AVI
or maybe even the likes of AviSynth in years to come.
