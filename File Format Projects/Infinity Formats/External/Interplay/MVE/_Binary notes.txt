There are two IE *.MVE MVEs that have multiple create timer opcodes:
* BG\BIOWBOTH.MVE
* BG\INTRO.MVE

Both use the same frame rate, so I can only really assume that these two movies were appended.
While it scarily implies a variable framerate (not that scary, but I am thinking of exporting to
*.avi, so it would be a problem), at least for the Infinity Engine, this can be bypassed.

As for video data, there is a 1:1 relationship between the opcode that stores video frame data
and the set decodeing map opcode. [Presumably, the map always comes first.] Past that, it would
appear that each frame is stored as one single opcode pair, making for easy indexing.

Audio and video match fairly closely, as the sum of audio samples uncompressed data length for a
given channel, the sample width and the number of channels, is very close.

i.e. video: 1711 frames / 15
	= 114.06666666666666666666666666667 seconds
i.e. audio: 9569528 sample length / 2 channels / 2 bytes pr sample / 22050 samples per second
	= 108.49804988662131519274376417234 seconds

video is actually off (multiplier is not 15 exactly), and more like:
	1711 frames / 14.986212684330416017264117012349 frames per second
	= 114.171608 seconds of video
