The more I look into this, the more I question just how much I want to implement a Bink decoder
when FFMpeg should do the job just fine.

I'm going to switch to investigating Platform Invoke or C++/CLI and using FFMPEG instead, since
there are only 7 fudging files in total.

Also, I want to support H.264/H.263 playback in iep1; persently abandoning this approach.

Also, if P/Invoke goes well, I might just use libPNG, libGIF in a similar fashion
