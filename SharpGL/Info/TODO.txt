SharpGL Version 1.5
*	Update ErrorCheck for GLU.

*	Update texture code so that resizing an image resises to a power of two found 
	by getting the MSB of a number e.g 
	00010110
	   |
	   Most Significant bit (8).
	   
*	Create wrappers for the attribute groups so you can do this:-
	Attributes.Line lineSettings = new Attributes.Line();
	lineSettings.Width = 15;
	...etc..
	lineSettings.Set();			//	Pushes attribute stack.
	...code here...
	lineSettings.Restore();		//	Pops attribute stack.
	
	DONE!

*	Change camera drawing code so a display list that draws a camera shape is executed
	and the view volume is changed.
	
***	OpenGL should be able to return any attribute group with the CURRENT attribute
	settings, this would make it easier to use, e.g 
	
	LightingAttributes light = gl.LightingAttributes;
	light.enabled = false;
	light.Set(gl);
	...
	light.Restore(gl);
	
	It would also allow for easier SharpForce specific attributes, e.g. 
	void Set(OpenGL gl)
	{
		LightingAttributes previous  = gl.LightingAttributes;
		...
	}
	void Restore(OpenGL gl)
	{
		previous.Set(gl);
	}
	
	Without having to use the matrix stack.
